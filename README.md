# Walmart---Confidence-Interval-and-CLT
 * Conducted statistical analysis on Walmart customer purchase behaviour using Confidence intervals and the
 Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to explore spending patterns.
 * Compared average spending across gender, marital status and age groups, identifying significant differences
 and potential customer segments.
 * Analysed outliers and variation in spending and build actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies
 and improved business decision-making

 # Findings:
 ## Gender wise comparison:

* As per the Box plot, Total Purchase Value - Gender Wise It shows male has spend more amount than Female but still we can't declare that the average spend of male is higher than female without proper analysis
* for 95% confidence Interval with sample size of 300 with confidence level of 95% for male is 8861 to 10000 and for female is 8204 to 9296. both of them are overlapping with each other
* for a sample size of 500, with 1000 times sampling, Avg mean of female lies between 8339 and 9159 and for Male is 9004 to 9882. Both the range are overlapping hence we will try to increase the sample size.
* for a sample size of 1000 with sampling times - 1000, confidence Interval - Avg mean of purchase for female lies between 8447 and 9062 and for male lies between 9120 and 9767. With this we conclude that **Male Avg spending is higher than Female**
* when we further **increase the sample size and reduce the confidence level**, the Avg mean of female lies between 8470 and 9020 and for male is between 9162 and 9686, shows that male average is higher than female

## Marital Status Comparison:

* By looking at the barplot there is not much difference between Married and Unmarried Customers on the Amount spent on their purchase.
* Even after increasing the sample size to 2000 and sampling time to 5000, Confidence Interval range of both married and Unmarried has not much difference compare to each other.
* Even with confidence level of 99% and 90% there is overlapping.  **We conclude that Marital Status has effect on the Amount spent on the Purchases**.

## Age Category Comparison:

* As per the barplot the total Purchase amount spent is low for age below 17 and high for age above 51 and between 18 to 50 its almost at the same level, even comparing the average amount spent, 0 to 17 age is the lowest and above 51 is the highest.
* Even for sample size of 500, range of all category is overlapping with each other. Hence we can't confirm which Age Category has the higher Average amount of purchase spent. We have to increase the sample size again
* By increasing the sample size to 1000, with 1000 times sampling with confidence level of 95% still there is overlapping among all the categories.
* **Only by increasing the sample size to 2000**, with 1000 times sampling with confidence level of 95% we found that **the average mean of amount spend by Age below 17 category is the lower than Age51+ category**
* **By decreasing the confidence level to 90%, we found that the average mean of amount spend by age below 17 is lower than 36-50 and 51+ category**. Rest all category are at the same range.
* **By decreasing the confidence level to 90% and increasing the sample size to 2000, we found that the average mean of amount spend by age below 17 is lower than 36-50 and 51+ category**. Rest all category are at the same range.
